Mesh 'hello world' assignment starter code.

There are several files, but you should mainly change src/R3Mesh.[cpp/h].

  src/ - Directory with source code 
    meshpro.cpp - Main program, parses the command line arguments, and calls the appropriate mesh processing functions
    meshview.cpp - Interactive program for viewing meshes and making images of meshes
    R3Mesh.[cpp/h] - Mesh class with processing functions (these are likely the only source files that you need to edit)
    R2/ - A library of useful 2D geometric primitives (includes R2Image and R2Pixel)
    R3/ - A library of useful 3D geometric primitives
