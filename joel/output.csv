		I’m on sabbatical now. I left my last job, at Juno Online Services, last November. Since then I’ve been traveling, learning, and resting up for the next big thing. Over the next few months I plan to write several articles about software development in this weblog. Keep an eye out for discussions on managing teams of developers at high tech companies; how to motivate and excite people; strategies for software firms, and more.
