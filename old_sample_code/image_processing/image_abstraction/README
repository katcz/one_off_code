This is an implementation of Kang's Flow-Based Image Abstraction in C/C++.

Image abstraction is a form of non-photorealistic rendering that produces
a stylized visual abstraction of a given image that conveys shape outline
information as well as color information in a manner that preserves the 
natural characteristic of the image.

This is very computationally intensive and very sensitive to the parameter values.

See Kang's paper for for further details on the technique:
