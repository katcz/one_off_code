Provided is code to generate TSP art. TSP art is art 
that attempts to provide visual representations of 
images using solutions to the Travelling Salesman
Problem. Since this problem is known to be NP-complete,
we attempt here to find approximate solutions that are 
both nearly optimal as well as visually appealing.
