This is a little Python script I threw together rather quickly
when I was in my fourth year of undergraduate studies to help 
me prepare for the verbal section of the GRE. 

The script reads the vocabulary from the .csv file (which .csv
file used is hard coded in the script, this shouldn't be an 
efficiency problem since Python code is compiled JIT). See
the provided definitions1.csv for details on the format.

The user is tested on 50 words (this number can be changed in the
code). The user is not allowed to move on until the question is 
answered correctly.
