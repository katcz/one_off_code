I play several roles with my primary being the data integration technical lead; my others are senior inference engine developer and NLP engineer.

Data Integration Technical Lead:
* Independently revive and rebuild a 20 year old source-to-source compiler to generate SQL & SPARQL for data integration with our knowledge graph.
* Built a framework for integrating data from HTTP webservices into our knowledge graph search engine.
* Optimize compiler-generated SQL for performance on several SQL backends (PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, etc.).
* Expand our SQL data integration capabilities for ETL purposes (e.g. trigger and stored procedure generation).
* Meet with project managers in an Agile environment to meet client needs.
* Manage Jenkins jobs for running tests and builds as necessary as to facilitate continuous integration of new features.

Senior Inference Engine Developer:
* Interact directly with Inference engine clients on weekly basis.
* Built a framework for performing distributed knowledge graph search and ETL based on our proprietary inference engine.
* Optimize, test, and maintain knowledge graph search capabilities.
* Maintain and develop tests and tools for knowledge graph integrity maintenance on a 40 year old ever-expanding knowledge graph.

Natural Language Processing Engineer:
* Create deep-learning model (via pre-trained BERT models) for data-driven word-sense disabiguation for use in rule-based natural language to formal-logic language translation mechanisms.
* Develop automated natural language data cleaning utilities. 
* Expand natural language generation scope via vocabulary addition.

My miscellaneous contributions include:
* Mentoring junior software developers.
* Creating a training program for new employees.
* Training non-developers to take on software development roles by training them on data visualization, hashing optimizations, API design and development, etc.
