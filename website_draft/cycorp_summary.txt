Overall Plan:
@TODO Go through all annual reviews and expand details for each category
@TODO Shorten them down at the end

All Categories
* Graph DB / Knowledge Graph Search Optimization Engineer
* Data Inegration Architect
* Mentor of Junior Developers
* Senior Inference Engine Developer (let's put CZER, WFF, transcriping, etc. here)
* Natural Language Generation Engineer (added Lexification Info, data driven word sense disambiguator)

# Graph DB / Knowledge Graph Search Optimization Engineer
Talk about #$isa and #$genls in SBHL and how this covers a lot of information.
Talk about how #$disjointWith covers #$not, that most systems cannot solve.
Talk about TVA and how it can be explosive if TVA in both args.
Talk about transitivity and how it's solvable quickly in GHL.

# Chief Data Inegration Architect

Data Inegration / Optimization
* Optimize SQL for several backends (Exasol, MySQL, MSSQLSERVER, MSAccess, CSVs, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SPARQL,IBM DB2, HTTP webservices)

SKSI++ in terms of rule proc conversion. Take a rule, make a trigger stored procedure.
SKSI++ : different SQL for Exasol than for postgres or mssql server. The latter two have a lot more support

DB side math for numeric and date types ; support auto incrementing keys

# Mentor of Junior Developers

    Training Noobies
    * SubL training
    ** Train non-developers to get up-to-speed so they can be useful on projects - concepts include data visualization, hasing optimizations, functional programming, lazy evlauation via iterators, abstraction violations, API design, backwards compatibility, space profiling, memory profiling
    ** Train non-developers to get up-to-speed on programming practices - Extreme programming, self-documenting code, style & conventions of cycorp, code maintainability

    Mentorship
    * Andrew Z on misc. things (@ todo add more details here)
    * Andrew P - worked with Andrew P on 
    * JPenkar on Integrating the Cyc back end with front end functionality (e.g. pragma suggestor, QGP)
    * Anton & Dave W - Built a framework for integrating data from HTTP webservices into our inference engine / graph search engine (i.e. API in SKSI)

# Senior Inference Engine Developer (let's put CZER, WFF, transcriping, etc. here)

Maintained and developed tools for knowledge graph integrity maintenance (e.g. pragma suggestor, sweep tests, CZER+WFF).
Inference engine optimization engineer.
Light Jenkins Experience to maintain stability. 
Client facing job as my clients are the OEs. "Interact with Inference engine clients on daily weekly basis to provide support."
Handle big slow downs (2**N tranlations in SKSI applicability, 2**N translations due to meaning sentences, 2**N in cost estimates for number of resultSetCardinality assertions to make)


# Natural Language Generation Engineer (added Lexification Info, data driven word sense disambiguator)
Text classification tasks: word sense disambiguation via BERT ; Lots of data cleaning and parsing (e.g. spell checker) ; lots of data generation and gathering (e.g. wikidata).
